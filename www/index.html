<h2>What Is ViewVC?</h2>

<p>ViewVC is a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version
   control repositories.  It generates templatized HTML to present
   navigable directory, revision, and change log listings.  It can
   display specific versions of files as well as diffs between those
   versions.  Basically, ViewVC provides the bulk of the report-like
   functionality you expect out of your version control tool, but much
   more prettily than the average textual command-line program
   output.</p>

<p>Here are some of the additional features of ViewVC:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support for filesystem-accessible CVS and Subversion repositories</li>
  <li>Individually configurable virtual host support</li>
  <li>Line-based annotation/blame display</li>
  <li>Revision graph capabilities (<em>CVS only</em>)</li>
  <li>Syntax highlighting support</li>
  <li>Commit metadata query facilities</li>
  <li>Template-driven output generation</li>
  <li>Colorized, side-by-side differences</li>
  <li>Tarball generation (by tag for CVS, by revision for Subversion)</li>
  <li>Localization support based on the Accept-Language request header</li>
  <li>Ability to run either as CGI script or as a standalone server</li>
  <li>Regexp-based file searching</li>
  <li>INI-like configuration file (as opposed to requiring actual code
      tweaks)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Screenshots</h2>

<p>Who needs screenshots when you can visit and interact with running
   ViewVC instances?  The following sites are running various versions
   of ViewVC:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ViewVC has been integrated into CollabNet Enterprise Edition,
      and is used by <a
      href="http://viewvc.tigris.org/source/browse/viewvc/">Tigris.org</a>
      to serve up displays of both CVS- and Subversion-backed projects
      hosted there (such as the ViewVC project itself).</li>
  <li>ViewVC is also deployed at <a
      href="http://viewcvs.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs/">SourceForge.net</a>,
      where it again serves up both CVS and Subversion repositories.</li>
  <li>The Subversion development community uses ViewVC on <a
      href="http://svn.collab.net/viewvc/svn/">svn.collab.net</a>.</li>
</ul>
