Bugfix ( 19-Feb-2002 - Daniel Berlin)
  * tparsemodule.cpp (tparse): Change tparseParser object to
    non-pointer.

Modif ( 13-Feb-2002)
  * Removed debugging statments from the (C++) Sink class.
  * Changed INSTALL to reflect the move of rcsparse to lib/vclib/ccvs/rcsparse.
  * Now when tparse cannot import common.py, it fails.
  * Added check for sink being of common.Sink class.
  
Modif ( 11-Feb-2002)
  * Support for parser exceptions  ( RCS* ):
     tparse will try import those exceptions from the "common" module.
     If it fails, tparse create those exceptions inside itself.
  * Changed the INSTALL file to make installation clearer.

Modif ( 08-Feb-2002)
  * Added Daniel Berlin's patch:
    Use a buffer stdiobufstream to access a python File in C++.
    Much faster.
