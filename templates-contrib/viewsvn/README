I.   INTRODUCTION


ViewVC is a Subversion and CVS webbased repository viewer. Templates-viewsvn is
a set of templates for a different look & feel.

Warning:
Do not use this template set if you plan to view cvs repositories through ViewVC! 
This template-set is heavily trimmed for Subversion needs. Special CVS features are 
untested, possibly disabled or broken.
