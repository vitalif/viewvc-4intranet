I.   BASIC INSTALLATION


Let ViewVC use the viewsvn templates folder as templates. You can either delete the original
templates folder in the ViewVC installation directory and copy the one from this archive to
the ViewVC installation directory or copy the templates folder from this archive with a different 
name to the ViewVC installation directory and change the template_dir option in viewvc.conf

template_dir = templates-viewsvn

Leave the section [templates] as is, thus do not override any templates. 



 
II.  TWEAKS


1. Set your own favicon

Modify include/header.ezt, line 9, to include your favicon.


2. Let your own logo appear in the upper right area and link to your homepage. 

Modify include/header.ezt, line 78, to include your link and logo.


3. Enable TortoiseSVN checkout links.

If you are certain that most of your guest use TortoiseSVN you can give them the ability
to use TortoiseSVN checkout links 
(see http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-repository-links.html). This wil
only work if all your repositories share the same base location, e.g. http://svn.server/svn/.
This is mostly the case if you are using the mod_dav_svn SVNParentPath directive.
 
Modify include/dir_footer.ezt, line 44. Enable this section and configure your subversion location. 




III. EXTRAS


1.   fix-blame-output.diff

If you are running ViewVC 1.0 and you are suffering from a broken blame/annotate output because of
long author names you can apply this patch. Note that Subversion 1.3.1 or higher is required.


2.   svnindex.xsl & svnindex.css

If you are using mod_dav_svn to host your repository you can teach it to use a stylesheet if you are 
browsing the repository directly. Take a look at the SVNIndexXSLT directive for more information.
You can use the .xsl and .css from the extras folder to get a look & feel that is similiar to this
ViewVC template. Note that these stylesheets knows nothing about ViewVC. You have to teach
svnindex.xsl where the [docroot] folder exists. If it is /docroot you have to change nothing, 
otherwise edit line 68, 82 and 97.
